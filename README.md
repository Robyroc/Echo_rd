Echo_rd
=====

An Erlang library that implements the chord P2P system.
For more details see there https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/ton:chord/paper-ton.pdf.

Build
-----

    $ rebar3 compile
    
Interface
-----

The library allows to abstract the location of a service and distribute it. All the commands of the service are not changed by Echo_rd, it just routes them to the node handling it correctly.

The application can send messages to the library with the following atoms: 
- create, will create a new Chord network. Needs also a parameter to specify the number of bits of the indexes of the network.
- join, will enter a network. Needs also an address of a node part of the interested network.
- leave, will leave (softly) the network.
- service_command, will perform a command on a resource. Needs the index of the resource and the complete command that can be handled by the service. 


Modules
-----

- ApplicationManager/API/chord: it will handle the communication with the upper level (application and service manager).
- RouterManager: it will handle all the routing operations and all the other tasks needed to keep routing consistently.
- CommunicationManager: it will handle all the messages received from the network.
- LinkManager: it will handle the communication with the lower level (typically tcp). It's strictly dependent on the 4th level protocol used. In this version we'll use TCP.

Where:
- The **ID** field column the id of the event
- The **Curr_State** column represents the current state, i.e. the state from which the transition comes from
- The **Action** column represents the incoming request (for the timeout scenarios is used the notation id1)
- The **Re-Action** column represents the state-machineâ€™s response w.r.t. the corresponding action
- The **New_State** column represents the new state after the event
