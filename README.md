Echo_rd
=====

An Erlang library that implements the chord P2P system.
For more details see there https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/ton:chord/paper-ton.pdf.

Build
-----

    $ rebar3 compile
    
Interface
-----

The library allows to abstract the location of a service and distribute it. All the commands of the service are not changed by Echo_rd, it just routes them to the node handling it correctly.
The library will need a block service providing an interface compatible with [gen_bm.erl](src/gen_bm.erl) file.

An example of an implemented block service can be seen here: https://github.com/GiacomoZiffer/Eblock_rd

The full list of methods complete with a brief explanation can be seen in the [gen_app.erl](src/gen_app.erl) file.
 

Modules
-----

- **application_manager**: it will handle the communication with the upper level (application and block manager);
- **checker**: it will handle the communication with the predecessor on the network. It will also handle the address (and id) of the predecessor;
- **communication_manager**: it will encode and decode incoming/outcoming messages and route them properly;
- **fixer**: it will make lookups in order to update the finger table entries;
- **hash_f**: it will provide methods for the hashing of addresses and resources;
- **join_handler**: it will handle the status of the node regarding join/create/leave;
- **lager_sinks_handler**: it will provide methods for the correct execution of lager logging;
- **link_manager**: it will create/manage tcp sockets;
- **logging_policies**: it will handle the filters on the logging based on the chosen policy;
- **lookup_request**: it will handle a single lookup request waiting for response;
- **naming_handler**: it will handle all naming operations;
- **naming_manager**: it will handle the naming table when naming_handler doesn't exist or is restarting;
- **normalizer**: it will handle all the operations on nodes id;
- **params_handler**: it will handle values needed for the execution after entering a network;
- **request_gateway**: it will handle and create all the lookup_request present;
- **router**: it will handle the finger table and the lookup mechanism;
- **socket_handler**: it will handle a single tcp connection;
- **socket_listener**: it will listen for tcp connections;
- **stabilizer**: it will handle the successor list and handles the communication with the successor;
- **statistics**: it will provide useful metrics to analyze the network.

Configuration
-----

Echo_rd can be configured using 

    $ application:set_env(echo_rd, #VAR#, #VAL#).
    
The following table shows the possible configurations (in square brackets default values):

Where:
- The **ID** field column the id of the event
- The **Curr_State** column represents the current state, i.e. the state from which the transition comes from
- The **Action** column represents the incoming request 
- The **Re-Action** column represents the state-machine’s response w.r.t. the corresponding action
- The **New_State** column represents the new state after the event

*Observation*:
* For the id of the timeout scenarios is used the following notation:
    * **ti** for the default interval
    * **tj** for the join interval
    * **tl** for the leaving interval
* For the ready_for_info message we have the IDs i1,i2 and m1,m2 according to the priority of the joiner who has to be served.
